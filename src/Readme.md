The `useState` hook in React is used to manage and persist the component's state. In the code you shared, `useState` is used to store and update the following pieces of information: `city`, `weatherData`, and `error`. Here’s why it is used and how it works:

### 1. **Managing the City Input (`city`)**:

- `const [city, setCity] = useState("");`

The `city` state variable holds the user’s input, i.e., the city name they enter into the text input field. `useState("")` initializes the city state as an empty string.

- The `setCity` function allows you to update the city when the user types in the input field. The input field is a **controlled component**, meaning its value is linked directly to the state (`city`).
- When the user types, the `onChange` event handler updates the state with `setCity(e.target.value)` to reflect the input field’s current value.

### 2. **Storing Weather Data (`weatherData`)**:

- `const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState(null);`

The `weatherData` state stores the response from the weather API. Initially, it's set to `null`, but after the API call is successful, `setWeatherData(data)` updates the state with the fetched weather data.

- Since React re-renders the component whenever the state changes, updating `weatherData` with the fetched data will cause the component to re-render and display the weather details in the UI.

- Without `useState`, the fetched data would not be stored, and you wouldn't be able to dynamically update and display the fetched weather information.

### 3. **Handling Errors (`error`)**:

- `const [error, setError] = useState(null);`

The `error` state holds any error message related to the API request (e.g., if the city is not found or there's a network error). By default, it's set to `null`, meaning no error exists initially.

- If the API call fails or if the city is not found, `setError(data.message)` or `setError("Failed to fetch weather data")` is used to update the `error` state, which triggers the error message to be shown to the user.

### Why Use `useState`?

1. **Reactivity**: When you update the state (e.g., `city`, `weatherData`, or `error`), React automatically re-renders the component, ensuring the UI is always in sync with the current state.
2. **Persistence Across Renders**: The state managed by `useState` persists across renders. Without `useState`, every time the component re-renders, the variables would be reset, losing the input and data.

3. **Interactivity**: React's `useState` allows the app to respond to user input. For example:
   - When a user types in a city name, `setCity` keeps track of the input.
   - After fetching the weather data, `setWeatherData` updates the UI to show the data.
   - If there's an error, `setError` makes sure the error message is displayed.

Without `useState`, you wouldn't be able to track these changes over time or react to user inputs and data fetches dynamically.

### Summary:

- **`useState`** is essential for keeping track of the values that change (like city input, API data, and errors), allowing your app to respond dynamically to user actions and external data.
- It ensures your UI is always up-to-date with the latest data from user inputs and API responses.
